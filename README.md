# bikesharing
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau

## Overview
The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. Even though, the two locations are quite different, analyzing the data over NYC, will help give insights and answer key questions!
- What gender uses the bikes most?
- What weekdays are the busiest?
- What bikes are to be repaired and what's the best time to repair them?
